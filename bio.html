			<h1>This is my bio.</h1>
			<p id = "bio_p">I am just an easy going guy from New Jersey. Some of my hobbies include soccer, programming, and going on adventures with friends. I love going on adventures no matter how big or small so do not be afraid to ask if I want to tag along. In the future, I dream of  traveling to Japan and eating some Michelin Starred ramen.  Some of the people I look up to are Elon Musk and Gordon Ramsay. Thank you for checking out my website!</p>
