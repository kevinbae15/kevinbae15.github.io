			<h1>This is my bio</h1>
			<p id = "bio_p">I am a very laid back person. Some of my hobbies include soccer, programming, and messing around  with my good friend Minhee. My experience as a Tufts student has changed me for the better and I hope to grow as a person even more than I have already. Peace.</p>
