			<h1>This is my bio.</h1>
			<p id = "bio_p">I am a very laid back person. I am from New Jersey, the best state in the US in my opinion. Some of my hobbies include soccer, programming, and messing around  with my friends. Love going on adventures no matter how big or small as well as trying out new food. In the future, I dream of  traveling to Japan and eating some of their Michelin Starred ramen.  Some of the people I look up to are Elon Musk and Gordon Ramsay. Thanks for checking out my website. Peace.</p>
