			<h1>This is my bio.</h1>
			<p id = "bio_p">Went to Northern Valley Old Tappan High School in New Jersey and then moved the Massachusetts to study at Tufts University. Some of my hobbies include soccer, racket sports, cooking, gaming, and photography. If I could learn any skill instantly, it would be woodworking and mountain climbing. In the future, I dream of traveling to Japan and eating some Michelin Starred shoyu ramen.</p>
